# DSA Question on Array

## Question 1: Find the Maximum Subarray Sum

**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

**Hint:**
Consider using Kadane's Algorithm to solve this problem efficiently.
